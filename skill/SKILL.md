# Pokémon Player Skill

Play Pokémon games autonomously via headless emulation. Uses the `pokemon-agent`
package to run a game server, then interacts via HTTP API.

## Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
# Install the package + emulator + dashboard
pip install pokemon-agent[dashboard] pyboy

# User must provide their own ROM file
# The agent CANNOT download or distribute ROMs
```

Ask the user for the ROM file path if not provided, or start onboarding so the
user can upload/select their own legally obtained ROM:

```bash
pokemon-agent onboard --port 9876 --data-dir ~/.pokemon-agent-gold
```

Common local locations:
- `~/roms/pokemon_gold.gbc`
- `~/roms/pokemon_silver.gbc`
- `~/roms/pokemon_red.gb`

## Starting a Game

```bash
# Start the game server as a background process
pokemon-agent serve --rom <ROM_PATH> --port 8765 &

# Verify it's running
curl -s http://localhost:8765/health
```

Tell the user: "Dashboard available at http://localhost:8765/dashboard"

For this repository's Gold service, the helper/default user service commonly uses
ports `9876` or `9879` and data dir `~/.pokemon-agent-gold`. ROM switching is
restart-based and per-ROM learning/saves/runs are isolated under
`games/<game>-<romhash>`.

## Gameplay Loop

Each turn, follow this cycle:

### 1. Observe — Read Game State

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8765/state | python3 -m json.tool
```

Parse the JSON to understand:
- Where am I? (map name, position)
- What's happening? (overworld, battle, dialog, menu)
- Party status? (HP, levels, any fainted?)
- Bag contents? (potions, pokeballs?)
- Badges earned?

### 2. Decide — What To Do

**Priority order:**
1. If in dialog → press A to advance (`a_until_dialog_end`)
2. If in battle → choose best move (see Battle Strategy)
3. If party needs healing → navigate to Pokémon Center
4. If ready for next gym → navigate toward it
5. Otherwise → explore, train, catch Pokémon

Use Hermes memory to track:
- Current objective: `PKM:OBJECTIVE: Defeat Brock in Pewter City`
- Map knowledge: `PKM:MAP: Viridian Forest has bug catchers, exit north to Pewter`
- Strategy notes: `PKM:STRATEGY: Brock's Onix is weak to Water — use Bubble`

### 3. Act — Send Commands

```bash
# Single action
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["press_a"]}'

# Movement sequence
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["walk_up", "walk_up", "walk_right", "press_a"]}'

# Advance dialog
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["a_until_dialog_end"]}'
```

### 4. Verify — Check Result

After each action, the response includes `state_after`. Check:
- Did I move? (position changed)
- Did the dialog advance? (new text or cleared)
- Did the battle state change? (HP, turn)

If stuck (same state after 3+ actions), try:
1. Press B to cancel menus
2. Try different direction
3. Load last save

Gold/Silver V2/adaptive already implements bounded resume behavior: blocked-edge
recovery, adaptive button probes, battle no-progress resume, ambiguous dialogue
resume, and supervisor handoff between V1 and adaptive when local recovery fails.

## Action Reference

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `press_a` | Press A (confirm, talk, interact) |
| `press_b` | Press B (cancel, run from battle) |
| `press_start` | Open menu |
| `press_select` | Select button |
| `walk_up/down/left/right` | Walk one tile |
| `wait_60` | Wait ~1 second |
| `a_until_dialog_end` | Mash A until dialog finishes |
| `hold_a_30` | Hold A for 30 frames |

## Battle Strategy (Gen 1)

### Type Effectiveness — Key Matchups
- **Water beats**: Fire, Ground, Rock
- **Fire beats**: Grass, Bug, Ice
- **Grass beats**: Water, Ground, Rock
- **Electric beats**: Water, Flying
- **Ground beats**: Fire, Electric, Rock, Poison
- **Ice beats**: Grass, Ground, Flying, Dragon
- **Fighting beats**: Normal, Rock, Ice
- **Psychic beats**: Fighting, Poison (VERY strong in Gen 1)

### Decision Tree
1. Can I one-shot? → Use strongest super-effective move
2. Am I at type disadvantage? → Switch if possible, or use neutral STAB
3. Is enemy HP high? → Consider stat moves first (Growl, Tail Whip)
4. Should I catch? → Weaken to red HP, use Poké Ball
5. Wild battle, don't need it? → Run (press_b or use "Run" option)

### Gen 1 Quirks
- Special stat is BOTH Special Attack and Special Defense
- Psychic type has NO effective counters (Ghost moves bugged, Bug moves weak)
- Critical hit rate based on Speed stat
- Wrap/Bind/Fire Spin prevent the opponent from acting

## Saving

```bash
# Save before important battles
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/save \
  -d '{"name": "before_brock"}'

# Load if things go wrong
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/load \
  -d '{"name": "before_brock"}'

# List available saves
curl -s http://localhost:8765/saves
```

Save before: Gym battles, catching rare Pokémon, entering dungeons.

## Progression Milestones

For Gold/Silver, track these in memory as they complete:

1. ☐ Choose starter in Elm's Lab
2. ☐ Reach Cherrygrove City
3. ☐ Visit Mr. Pokémon and receive Mystery Egg
4. ☐ Return to Elm and receive Pokédex
5. ☐ Prepare for Falkner with level/HP/resource gates
6. ☐ **Zephyr Badge** (Falkner)
7. ☐ Reach Azalea and clear Slowpoke Well
8. ☐ **Hive Badge** (Bugsy)
9. ☐ Reach Goldenrod
10. ☐ **Plain Badge** (Whitney)
11. ☐ Continue Johto badges, Elite Four, Kanto badges, Red

Fresh Gold/Silver V2/adaptive runs rotate starters
`cyndaquil -> totodile -> chikorita` and nicknames `A`, `AA`, `AAA`, `AAAA`,
`AAAAA` through `gold_autoplayer_v2_learning.json:starter_selection`.

## Memory Conventions

Use these prefixes in Hermes memory for Pokémon-related entries:
- `PKM:OBJECTIVE:` — Current goal
- `PKM:MAP:` — Map/navigation knowledge
- `PKM:STRATEGY:` — Battle/team strategy notes
- `PKM:PROGRESS:` — Milestone completion
- `PKM:STUCK:` — Notes about stuck situations and how they were resolved

## Taking Screenshots

```bash
# Save screenshot for vision analysis
curl -s http://localhost:8765/screenshot -o /tmp/pokemon_screen.png
```

Use `vision_analyze` on the screenshot when:
- You're unsure what's on screen (menus, NPCs)
- You need to read in-game text that RAM doesn't capture well
- You want to verify your position visually

## Stopping

When done playing:
1. Save the game: `curl -X POST localhost:8765/save -d '{"name": "session_end"}'`
2. Kill the background server process
3. Save progress notes to memory
